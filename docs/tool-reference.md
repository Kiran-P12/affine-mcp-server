# Tool Reference

`tool-manifest.json` is the source of truth for the canonical tool names exposed by this server.

Use this document as a grouped catalog. For exact schemas, your MCP client should inspect `tools/list`.

## Conventions

- Canonical names only: legacy alias names are not part of the public tool surface
- Document editing relies on AFFiNE WebSocket-backed operations where noted
- Experimental organize tools are marked explicitly
- Use `AFFINE_TOOL_PROFILE=read_only`, `core`, or `authoring` in production if you want a reduced surface

## Edgeless canvas and surface elements

AFFiNE's edgeless doc has two layers: top-level edgeless blocks (`note`, `frame`, `edgeless-text`) with `prop:xywh`, and the surface layer (`affine:surface`) which stores free-floating shapes, connectors, canvas text, and groups in `prop:elements.value` — the native BlockSuite representation.

| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `get_edgeless_canvas` | Read the full canvas: edgeless blocks + surface elements with parsed `{x,y,width,height}`, aggregate `bounds`, per-type `elementCounts` | Deterministic z-order (fractional-index sorted). Note entries carry a structured `children` array of their block descendants (`flavour`, `type`, `text`, `language`, `checked`) so markdown-seeded content round-trips faithfully. |
| `add_surface_element` | Add a `shape`, `connector`, `text`, or `group` to the surface | Shapes: rect/ellipse/diamond/triangle with fill, stroke, and text. Connectors accept `sourceId`/`targetId` and optional `sourcePosition`/`targetPosition` relative `[x,y]` in `[0,1]`. When both endpoints are bound by id and neither position is supplied, they auto-snap to BlockSuite's four tangent-carrying side-midpoints based on relative bounds. Creates the surface block if the doc doesn't have one. |
| `list_surface_elements` | List all surface elements (optionally filter by `type` or `elementId`) | Returns raw `xywh` plus parsed `bounds` sorted by fractional `index` ascending; serializes `Y.Text` fields to plain strings. |
| `update_surface_element` | Partially update an element by id | `x`/`y`/`width`/`height` merge with current `xywh` (move without resizing, or vice versa). `text`/`label`/`title` replace their `Y.Text` wholesale. Fields not applicable to the element's type come back in the response `ignored` list. |
| `delete_surface_element` | Delete an element by id | `pruneConnectors: true` additionally removes any connectors referencing the deleted element. |
| `update_frame_children` | Replace a frame block's contents wholesale | Every resolved id (surface element or edgeless block) goes into `prop:childElementIds` and comes back in `ownedIds`; unknown ids in `missing`. Default `resizeToFit: true` recomputes xywh to match new contents + `padding` + title band; pass `resizeToFit: false` to preserve the current box. Pass `[]` to clear ownership (resize skipped). |
| `update_edgeless_block` | Partially update a note/frame/edgeless-text block | `x`/`y`/`width`/`height` merge with current `prop:xywh`; `background` replaces `prop:background`. Fields not applicable to the flavour come back under `ignored`. Use for repositioning / resizing / recoloring without re-creating the block. |
| `delete_block` | Delete a block by id | Removes descendants and unlinks from the parent's `sys:children` by default. `deleteChildren: false` keeps descendants orphaned; `pruneConnectors: true` also drops surface connectors referencing any deleted id. Refuses `affine:page`. |

### Layout helpers on `append_block`

When the new block is a frame/note/edgeless_text on the canvas, `append_block` accepts three optional fields that compute coordinates from the current doc state instead of the caller doing arithmetic:

| Field | Applies to | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `markdown` | `type="note"` | Parse markdown into heading/paragraph/list/code child blocks inside the note. Height auto-estimated from the content when `height` is omitted. |
| `childElementIds: [id, ...]` | `type="frame"` | The frame's contents. Accepts ids of surface elements (shapes/connectors/groups) AND edgeless blocks (notes/frames/edgeless-text) — every resolved id goes into `prop:childElementIds`, matching what BlockSuite's editor writes when you drag members into a frame. Dragging the frame drags every owned member. Unresolved ids come back under `missing`. If `width`/`height` are omitted, the frame is sized to the union of resolvable bounds + `padding` + a 30px title band. |
| `stackAfter: { blockId, direction?, gap? }` | any canvas block | Position relative to one or more existing siblings. `blockId` may be an array — picks whichever ref is furthest in the stack direction (useful when stacking below a row of columns) and centers the new block on the union bounds' orthogonal axis (when widths match, same as inheriting the anchor's x). Caller-provided `x` / `y` on the orthogonal axis still wins. Default `gap` is direction-aware: **80px horizontal** (left/right), **40px vertical** (up/down) — mirrors native-flowchart spacing where the flow axis gets more breathing room. |
| `padding` | used by `childElementIds` auto-sizing and as fallback `gap` for `stackAfter` | Default 40. Explicit `padding` on the block overrides the direction-aware default; explicit `stackAfter.gap` wins over both. |
