# AFFiNE MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for AFFiNE. It exposes AFFiNE workspaces and documents to AI assistants over stdio (default) or HTTP (`/mcp`) and supports both AFFiNE Cloud and self-hosted deployments.

## Overview

AFFiNE MCP Server is designed for three common scenarios:
- Run a local stdio MCP server for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, or Claude Desktop
- Expose a remote HTTP MCP endpoint for hosted or browser-connected clients
- Automate AFFiNE workspace, document, database, organization, and comment workflows through a stable MCP tool surface

Highlights:

- Supports AFFiNE Cloud and self-hosted AFFiNE instances
- Supports stdio and HTTP transports
- Supports token, cookie, and email/password authentication
- Exposes 84 canonical MCP tools backed by AFFiNE GraphQL and WebSocket APIs
- Includes semantic page composition, native template instantiation, database intent composition, capability and fidelity reporting, and workspace blueprint helpers
- Includes Docker images, health probes, and end-to-end test coverage

Scope boundaries:

- This server can access only server-backed AFFiNE workspaces
- Browser-local workspaces stored only in local storage are not available through AFFiNE server APIs
- AFFiNE Cloud requires API-token-based access for MCP usage; programmatic email/password sign-in is blocked by Cloudflare

> New in v2.0.0: Added native edgeless canvas tools and shipped a slimmer 84-tool public surface with least-privilege profiles for read-only, core, and authoring deployments.

### Canonical doc-link form (`affine://doc/<docId>`)

Workspace-internal links round-trip through markdown using the URI scheme `affine://doc/<docId>`. This matches the existing `affine://blob/<sourceId>` precedent and parses as a standard URL through any third-party markdown processor.

**Writing**: any `[Title](affine://doc/<docId>)` in `append_markdown` or `create_doc_from_markdown` produces a clickable inline `LinkedPage` reference — not a card embed view. The same form on a paragraph of its own also produces an inline reference, never auto-promoting to an `affine:embed-linked-doc` card. The explicit `append_block` write path with `type: "embed_linked_doc"` likewise produces a paragraph containing one inline reference, so agents see one consistent block shape regardless of which write surface they used.

**Reading**: `read_doc` surfaces a structured `references: [{from, to, pageId, title}]` array on every text-bearing block (paragraphs, headings, lists, quotes, callouts, table cells with a `cellId` discriminator, database row titles, edgeless text). `affine:embed-linked-doc` card blocks (created via the AFFiNE UI's drag-drop affordance) surface their target with `pageId` and `linkedTitle` on the block row. `list_children` enumerates a doc's outgoing links with a `kind: "embed" | "inline"` discriminator and `sourceBlockId` so agents can traverse the workspace graph.

**Side effect**: external `[text](url)` markdown links also round-trip cleanly through write → read now (previously the renderer stripped link attributes, leaving bare text).

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the CLI

```bash
npm i -g affine-mcp-server
affine-mcp --version
```

You can also run the package ad hoc:

```bash
npx -y -p affine-mcp-server affine-mcp -- --version
```

### 2. Or run the server in Docker

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e MCP_TRANSPORT=http \
  -e AFFINE_BASE_URL=https://your-affine-instance.com \
  -e AFFINE_API_TOKEN=ut_your_token \
  -e AFFINE_MCP_AUTH_MODE=bearer \
  -e AFFINE_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN=your-strong-secret \
  ghcr.io/dawncr0w/affine-mcp-server:latest
```

Then point your client at:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "affine": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your-strong-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Docker, health checks, and remote deployment details, see [docs/configuration-and-deployment.md#docker](docs/configuration-and-deployment.md#docker).

### 3. Save credentials with interactive login

```bash
affine-mcp login
```

This stores credentials in `~/.config/affine-mcp/config` with mode `600`.

- For AFFiNE Cloud, use an API token from `Settings -> Integrations -> MCP Server`
- For self-hosted AFFiNE, you can use either an API token or email/password

### 4. Register the server with your client

Claude Code project config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "affine": {
      "command": "affine-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Codex CLI:

```bash
codex mcp add affine -- affine-mcp
```

More client-specific setup is in [docs/client-setup.md](docs/client-setup.md).

### 5. Verify the connection

```bash
affine-mcp status
affine-mcp doctor
```

If you want to expose the server remotely over HTTP instead of stdio, start with [docs/configuration-and-deployment.md](docs/configuration-and-deployment.md).

## Tool Surface

`tool-manifest.json` is the source of truth for canonical tool names. The MCP server exposes those tools through `tools/list` and `tools/call`.

Domains:

- Workspace: create, inspect, update, delete, and traverse workspaces
- Organization: collections, collection-rule sync, workspace blueprints, and experimental organize or folder helpers
- Documents: search, read, create, publish, move, tag, import/export, semantic composition, template inspection and native instantiation, capability and fidelity reporting, and block-level mutation
- Databases: create columns, add rows, update rows, inspect schema, and compose database structures from intent
- Comments: list, create, update, delete, and resolve
- History: version history listing
- Users and tokens: current user, sign-in, profile/settings, personal access tokens
- Notifications: list and mark notifications as read
- Blob storage: upload, delete, and cleanup blobs

Use `AFFINE_TOOL_PROFILE=read_only`, `core`, or `authoring` when a deployment should expose a smaller surface than the complete `full` default. You can also combine profiles with `AFFINE_DISABLED_GROUPS` such as `docs.database`, `destructive`, or `admin` for finer control.

For the grouped catalog, notes, and operational caveats, see [docs/tool-reference.md](docs/tool-reference.md).

## Verify Your Setup

Useful CLI commands:

- `affine-mcp status` - test the effective configuration
- `affine-mcp status --json` - machine-readable status output
- `affine-mcp doctor` - diagnose config and connectivity issues
- `affine-mcp show-config` - print the effective config with secrets redacted
- `affine-mcp config-path` - print the config file path
- `affine-mcp snippet <claude|cursor|codex|all> [--env]` - generate ready-to-paste client config
- `affine-mcp logout` - remove stored credentials

For common failures, see:

- [docs/getting-started.md#common-first-run-failures](docs/getting-started.md#common-first-run-failures)
- [docs/configuration-and-deployment.md#deployment-checklist](docs/configuration-and-deployment.md#deployment-checklist)

## Security and Scope

- Never commit secrets or long-lived tokens
- Prefer API tokens over cookies or passwords in production
- Use HTTPS for non-local deployments
- Rotate access tokens regularly
- Restrict exposed tools with `AFFINE_DISABLED_GROUPS` and `AFFINE_DISABLED_TOOLS` for least-privilege setups
- Use `/healthz` and `/readyz` when running the HTTP server behind a container platform or load balancer

## Development

Run the main quality gates before opening a PR:

```bash
npm run build
npm run test:tool-manifest
npm run pack:check
```

Additional validation:

- `npm run test:comprehensive` boots a local Docker AFFiNE stack and validates the tool surface
- `npm run test:e2e` runs Docker, MCP, and Playwright together
- `npm run test:playwright` runs the Playwright suite only
- Focused runners for the new high-level tool surface include `npm run test:create-placement`, `npm run test:capabilities-fidelity`, `npm run test:native-template`, `node tests/test-database-intent.mjs`, `node tests/test-semantic-page-composer.mjs`, `node tests/test-structured-receipts.mjs`, `node tests/test-organize-tools.mjs`, and `node tests/test-supporting-tools.mjs`

Local clone flow:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dawncr0w/affine-mcp-server.git
cd affine-mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```
